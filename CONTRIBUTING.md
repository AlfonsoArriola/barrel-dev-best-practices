## Contribution Process

### Adding Best Practices

Are you an expert? Expert opinions matter, but only if you have the time to share your knowledge.

1. Create a branch from master.
2. Issue a merge request from your branch to master.
3. Profit (not literally, but in the satisfaction that you contributed).

### Challenge or Recommend Best Practices

We're not robots, times change, and technologies evolve. We're happy to take some helpful criticism, especially if it's relevant, thoughtful, and logical. 

1. Search open issues first.
2. If your specific issue is missing, open a new issue.
3. Include the subject matter, your thoughts on the best practice or what's missing, and relevant links and examples.
4. Add a label to your issue.
