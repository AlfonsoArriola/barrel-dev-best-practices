# 10 Steps to exporting SVGs for Development

**Prerequisites:**
- Illustrator

## Sketch
If using Sketch, the exported SVGs are not the most optimized or "clean" output, so we recommend first exporting from Sketch and then into Illustrator.

1. Open SVG file in Illustrator
2. Export icon as `.svg` from Sketch (Steps 3-10 apply when saving an SVG from an icon created in Adobe Illustrator)

## The Steps
1. Open `.svg` file in Adobe Illustrator and ungroup all objects
2. Expand any strokes into outlines
3. Merge shapes that overlap/connect with one another
4. Cutout any areas from shape that are meant to be transparent
5. Make all paths compound paths
6. Size your artboard to fit the artwork
7. Copy your .svg and paste it into a new Illustrator file the same dimensions as your previous artboard
8. Save your file as an .svg â€“ using the default settings from Illustrator
